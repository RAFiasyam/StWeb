                    The IDN Middle School and Vocational Schools are under the IDN Foundation with the supervisor Mr. Dedi Gunawan, MT, CCIE. IDN Middle Schools and Vocational High Schools have a major advantage in the field of IT (information technology) which refers to the needs of the International IT industry. every child especially for the SMK level will be prepared to have skills and certifications to take part in the international world.<br>
                    <br>
                    IDN Middle and Vocational Schools are supported by IDN/ID-Network and Imastudio which have many clients in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East so that with this experience we are trying to get down to the world of education to be able to attract more Indonesians so they can thrive in the international world.<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to formal education, we also implement a diniyah education based on an understanding of the Koran and sunnah, so that in addition to building students' competencies in the IT field, they also develop their diniyah.<br>

                <p>This is where I live, I have been living in Boyolali since kindergarten.<br>
                    <br>
                    The anniversary of Boyolali's founding is commemorated on June 5, because the Surakarta Kasunanan government made new regulations regarding village administration or government outside Kuthanegara (Capital City) on June 5, 1847.<br>
                    <br>                    
                    the Serat Agreement Dalem Natha made between Pakubuwono VII and the Dutch Government in the belief that the incumbent government could not function fully.<br>
                    <br>
                    The agreement is contained in the Dalem Natha Fiber Agreement page 140 â€“ 146 or in Staatsblad 1847 No. 30. Chapters 30 â€“ 36. According to the Staatsblad of 1847 No.30, the Surakarta Sunanate Government formed six 'Mountain Districts' in its surroundings to assist the government in the area.<br>
                    <br>
                    The six regions are Surakarta City and Kartosuro, Klaten, Boyolali, Ampel and Sragen Regencies. (Pwarti Surakarta, 1939:71). Based on the Staatsblad, what became known as the anniversary of Boyolali Regency was June 5, 1847.<br>
